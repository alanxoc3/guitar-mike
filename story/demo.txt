Demo version:
   Go through woods. Get sword. Fight boss. Sister says sorry she left her
   brother. Go back to brother. He teaches you secret technique... Holding
   things. Grab chicken. Take to Jane. Get past Bob. Cue demo end!

   That would be a lot of work, but also very satisfying. Let's go for that
   much in a demo!

   This means that I can get rid of a few enemies, items, and rooms. But I will
   have to add in a title screen, demo screen, game over, and a boss fight.
