Ooooooh, what about autosave? I would do this by making Lank appear at the
start of the room when you reload. This would probably be implemented as I am
completing the game, to ensure it works correctly.

Ok. So sound... There are 3 things I think:

1. Make the volume like sub-tones. Check!
2. Pause the volume (for banjo). Check!
3. Fade the volume out (for music transition). Check!

4. Glitched volume (for hard mode). (This can be bitted down)
