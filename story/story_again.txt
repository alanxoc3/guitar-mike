- Start game.
- Flash back, Zeldo and Lank injured.
- In house.
- Grab banjo.
- Learn to play.
- Get boomerang or shield.
- Go through woods.
- Two brothers are in the house.
- Get sword.
- One brother is angry and fights you (first boss fight).
- Beat him, then the other brother asks where his brother is the rest of the game.
- Idea: secret ending, don't kill the brother.
- Grab chicken. Give wife.
- Wife gives you letter.
- Give letter to Bob. He goes home, while wife is making dinner.
- Go to graveyard.
- Open chest (says not to open).
- Graveyard dude enters house.
- If you find all ghosts, he gives you a shovel.
- Ghost by ramming tree, Ghost by blowing up rock, Ghost by throwing plant,
  Last back in graveyard house.
- 6 chickens. Chickens throughout the game. Last chicken noodle soup.
- Go into castle, maybe small puzzle.
- Chicken in cage with Zeldo.
- fight Cannon boss.
- Beat him, realize fairy is bad. Fairy tries to find square force.
- Cannon doesn't have the square force.
- They say lank has it. But Lank lost it.
- Fairy leaves, looking for square force.
- Cannon gives you cannon bombs.
- Need to get shovel now. Go to crypt.
- In crypt is previous fairy as boss.
- Beat fairy. Get key.
- You can open secret chest in your house now.
- Use square force to go to computer place.
- Find fairy there.
- Use square force to turn on computer, in generator room.
- Computer turns on. Fairy appears, fight fairy before he hacks the game.
- One of fairy's moves is dark lank.
- Easy mode is over.

- Hard mode is similar, after you beat easy mode, somehow you can activate hard mode.

- Also, you can buy the boomerang/shield later. And you buy the sword later too.
- If you didn't take the sword at the beginning, maybe you can get a better sword.
- Or maybe it can enable something for hard mode.



Ideas:
   - In hard mode, don't lose song memory.

   - We can do 4 pieces of the square force (this gets rid of the need for a key).
   - One piece is in Lank's chest.
   - One is with Novi.
   - Ivan has two (from Zeldo and Canon).
   - Banjo can then warp to save spots (learn song from banjo teacher).
   - Banjo dude says, "come talk to me when you found what you have lost."
   - Fairy says he gave the square force to Ivan, but does have a key (lank
     gave to fairy a long time ago).
   - Pots don't give you money. Only get money by playing music and with
     enemies.

Next Zeldo game is a year before.
