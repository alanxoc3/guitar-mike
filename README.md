# Guitar Mike

![alt text](guitar-mike.p8.png)

I made this for a "Music is a Weapon" game jam. The character sprite was done
by rotoscoping myself. The minifier was unneeded, but I had it available from
another project.

## Tasks
- TODO: Combine the Zeldo minifier with this one (make it modular).
- TODO: Make this game better?
